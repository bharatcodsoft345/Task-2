            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <h4>A Wedding Cake shop</h4>
            <p>We already do a great trade with the locals with our special coffees and gourmet pies, but there are also loads of small tour operators that drive past here every day. We thought that getting a simple brochure-type website up for the store would enable us to hand out business cards with the web address to tour operators who might be looking for a cosy atmosphere with great food and coffee on a rainy day.
                I guess if I had to sum up what I wanted people to think of when they looked at the site, it would be the same thing that I'd want them to feel entering our cafe: great coffee, tantalizing food in a classy but comfortable atmosphere. I'd love to chat to someone about what's possible....</p>
